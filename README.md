# ArtGan
Creating Art with Generative Adversarial Networks

Implementations of DC-GANs and WGANs in order to generate Art. Art images from Wikiart. MNIST and CIFAR-10 are also avalaible as toy datasets.
The networks are trained to not only learn the dataset distribution, but also be able to chose the art style generated. 

## Example of generated art
![Batch of Abstract Landscapes](https://github.com/Thomas0Gilles/ArtGan/blob/master/art_wgan_100.png)

## Mixing of different art style generated

The network is asked to generate 2 art styles at the same time.
