Creating Art with Generative Adversarial Networks

Implementations of DC-GANs and WGANs in order to generate Art. Art images from Wikiart. MNIST and CIFAR-10 are also avalaible as toy datasets.
The networks are trained to not only learn the dataset distribution, but also be able to chose the art style generated.
